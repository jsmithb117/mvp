npm init -y
mkdir -p src/client
mkdir -p dist
Installed webpack, babel, react and dependencies.
touch ./src/index.html ./src/index.js ./src/client/App.js .babelrc webpack.config.js
Populated .babelrc, webpack.config.js
Populated App.js, index.html, and index.js.
Added start, build, and create scripts to package.json

Committed initial build

Installed MongoDB 4.2.12
Made rough sketch of db schema

MongoDB doesn't like me.  Pivoting to mysql.
Wrote schema.sql, populated it with fake data.

Changing file structure of project to incorporate a server
/dist
/client
  /components
    App.js
  index.js
  index.html
/server
  /images (these should be in the db, they're going to live here for now)
  app.js
/db
  schema.sql

Created bare server with endpoints GET/, POST/login, POST/swipe

Began populating React components.  Faked logging in in Navbar.

Going to do end of day commit.  Win for today: I used hooks for the first time!

Apparently 'match' is a keyword of mysql and cannot be used as a column name.
Changed 'match' to 'matches' and from foreign key int to varchar(255)
